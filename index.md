## What and why

`tty-share` is a set of open-source command line tool that can be used to share an interactive
terminal session over the Internet. It is written in Go, and it should run in theory on all *unix*
systems (even on ARM). It contains a client side (`tty-sender`) and server side (`tty-server`). A
server instances runs at [tty-share.com](https://tty-share.com).
