## OSX

You can install `tty-share` via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager. Use:

```
brew install tty-share
```
After, run the simple command, and get the unique secret URL:
```
bash$ tty-share
Web terminal: https://go.tty-share.com/s/J5U6FAwChWNP0I9VQ9XyPqVD6m6IpI8-sBLRiz98XMA=

bash$
```

<br>
### Other platforms

If you don't have Homebrew configured, or need binaries for other platforms, check out the releases github project page: [github.com/elisescu/tty-share/releases](https://github.com/elisescu/tty-share/releases/latest).



<br>
### Source Code

To build the tool from source, you need a GO environment. Read more [here](https://golang.org/doc/install) about how to get that. After GO is installed and properly configured, you can simply do:

```
go get github.com/elisescu/tty-share
```
This will download and build the `tty-share` binary. For cross-compilation, and more details, check out the Github [project page](https://github.com/elisescu/tty-share).
